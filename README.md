## Perpose

- This repository tracks the C# script portion of the entire folder pointed to by the “FirstOfAll” repository.
- In order to maintain consistency across the entire Unity project files (collectively known as FirstOfAll), while at the same time maintaining organic and flexible interaction between the remote code-server and github codespace and the native code-server and remote vscode, we felt that a separate git repository tracking only the C# strips was necessary, hence the creation and maintenance of this repository.

## Repository Dependence & Struct of Cascading VCS

- we use this repository as the primary VCS for stripe development and maintenance work, and the Unity VCS (PlasticSCM) as the primary VCS for other work (unity work).
- Also, to maintain consistency across the entire project, we keep a history of the entire project in the “FirstOfAll” repository, backed up as a time series.
